This is a list of all the things that our tool has to contain sooner or later:

Backup Types:
	Jar Backups
	.minecraft dir Backups
	mod Backups
	MC User backups
	texturepack backups     - not needed that heavily
	world save backups
	server list backups
	  - add more :)

What the program can do:
	Create/Import, Edit, Restore, Delete and Export Backups
	Automatic mod installation (class files etc.)
	Automated error reporting
	Force update Minecraft
	Select an original version of minecraft and downgrade automatically



Side note:
	It should be possible to somehow restore the old backups
